# Hideout Manager for Escape From Tarkov

Image recognition & automation tool built in Python for popular game ‘Escape from Tarkov’. 
Utilizes Tensorflow, PIL and PyAutoGUI to gather game data and perform actions autonomously while running.

This was an educational / experimental project in my free time for handling automation in Escape From Tarkov. 
Ultimately, Tarkov has a lot of measures in place to prevent automation of the Hideout & Traders.
The code as it exists currently will have a lot of problems as the resources (fonts, in game items, traders, etc etc...) have all been updated or changed.

No code here is final or guaranteed fully functional, as my commits to the main branch contain a lot of WIP or experimental stuff.
